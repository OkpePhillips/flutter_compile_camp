# Todo App

This project is designed to showcase my understanding of Riverpod concepts. It is a simple but complete todo app that demonstrates:
- StateProvider for simple state
- StateNotifierProvider for complex state
- Provider for computed values
- ConsumerWidget for reactive UI
- ref.watch() vs ref.read() usage
- State immutability principles
